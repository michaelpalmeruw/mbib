# mbib
Bibliography manager for Linux, for use with both LaTeX and OpenOffice/Libreoffice

Status: the code is uploaded and should work, but the documentation is very incomplete.
I'm working on it and will update soon.

If you want to try it out now, here is a brief Howto:

- clone the repository

- make sure the mbib directory is your bash path, and the mbib.sh script inside it is executable

- install the prerequisites: Python 3, and the urwid and urwidtrees Python packages; xclip

- open a shell window and run mbib.sh
