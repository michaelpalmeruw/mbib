# mbib
Bibliography manager for Linux, for use with both LaTeX and OpenOffice/Libreoffice

Status: the code is reasonably complete and working. The documentation has a
tutorial that covers most topics, but the reference part is missing.

If you want to try it out, here is a brief Howto:

- clone the repository

- make sure the mbib directory is in your bash $PATH, and the mbib.sh script inside it is executable

- install the prerequisites: Python 3, the urwid, urwidtrees, and requests Python packages; xsel

- open a shell window and run mbib.sh
